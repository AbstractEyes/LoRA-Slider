---

A LoRA-Slider training script. A LoRA-Slider model can be trained without image samples. You can modify the weight of the LoRA-Slider to control a weight of a specific concept, such as age, weight and gender. A few trained Lora-Slider model can be downloaded in [here](https://civitai.com/models/281934/lora-slider).

## Usage

1.Prepare a *.json config file like this

```json
[
    {
        "target_prompt": "the concept to be enhanced",
        // such as "elderly person"
        "trigger_prompt": "trigger word", 
        // such as "person"
        "trigger_lora_weight": "positive", 
        // "positive" represents the concept will be enhanced with a positive weight of lora and be suppressed with a negative weight of lora.
        "guidance_scale": 3.0 
        // the guidance scale of target_prompt on trigger_prompt
    },
    {
        "target_prompt": "the concept to be enhanced",
        // such as "3-year-old person"
        "trigger_prompt": "trigger word", 
        // such as "person"
        "trigger_lora_weight": "negative", 
        // "negative" represents the concept will be enhanced with a negative weight of lora and be suppressed with a positive weight of lora.
        "guidance_scale": 3.0 
        // the guidance scale of target_prompt on trigger_prompt
    }
]

```
A few example *.json config files have been prepared in ./config folder.



2.Run python script `train_lora_slider.py` in command line.

```bash
accelerate launch train_lora_slider.py --pretrained_model_name_or_path runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 --prompt_config_path config/age_slider.json
```
Note that you need to run `accelerate config` in CLI at the first time.

3.Convert lora file from diffusersðŸ¤— format to webui format for inference if needed.
```bash
python convert_diffusers_sdxl_lora_to_webui.py <input_file> <output_file>
```
